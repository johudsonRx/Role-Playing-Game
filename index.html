<!-- Pseudo Code for Force Awakens RPG
1. Need button classes or ids that link up to the characters {
  -Once an id of a character is clicked, he goes into an "enemies available to attack screen". 
  -This button will be an entire element that updates how many hp points were taken away after you're attacked - Will have to program a path for characters to reach with attack damage. 
} 
2. Find a way to move defenders to middle of the screen after an attacker is chosen - See Captain Planet
3. Once a defender is chosen, he moves to a defender position - See Capatain Planet.
4. Game needs to keep track of all attack power at all times
